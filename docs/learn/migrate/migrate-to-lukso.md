# Migrate to LUKSO

:::info

This page gives an overview of the differences between building on LUKSO vs other EVM chains.

For more information on specific topics, see the following pages:

- [Introduction to the LSPs](../../standards/introduction.md).
- [Concepts & Glossary](../concepts.md) if you are not understanding certain terms.
- [Features & Benefits of Universal Profiles](../benefits-lukso-standards.md#universal-profiles-vs-smart-wallets) compared to traditional wallets.
- [Features & Benefits of LSP7/8 Token standards over](../benefits-lukso-standards.md#features-of-lsp-token-standards-over-erc20-and-erc721) compared to traditional wallets.

## Migrating from other EVM Chain

LUKSO is EVM-compatible. Any traditional web3 wallet (_e.g: Metamask_) can interact with LUKSO dApps.

1. Simply [add the LUKSO network in your wallet](../../networks/testnet/parameters.md) and switch to the LUKSO chain.
2. any Ethereum smart contract can be redeployed on LUKSO by connecting to a [LUKSO RPC endpoint](../../networks/mainnet/parameters).

You can start holding assets (LYX, tokens, and NFTs), transfer them, and deploy and interact with smart contracts.

Developers are encouraged to use LSP standards to enhance the experience using their projects. Some codebases may need adjustments to convert ERC interactions to LSP interactions. More details are provided below.

:::note Solidity functions

For more details on the different functions and Solidity interface, see the following pages and sections:

- [**Digital Asset (Token) > Comparison with ERC20**](../../contracts/overview/Token/index.md#comparisons-with-erc20).
- [**Identifiable Digital Asset (NFT) > Comparison with ERC721**](../../contracts/overview/NFT/index.md#comparisons-with-erc721).

Developers are encouraged to leverage the LSPs (**L**UKSO **S**tandards **P**roposals) to develop smart contracts, protocols and applications on LUKSO. The LSPs offer flexible functionalities that can:

- enable more complex and various features.
- be tailored to suit different use cases.
- bring a better experience to end dApp users.
