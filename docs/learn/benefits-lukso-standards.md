# Benefits of the LUKSO Standards

This page highlights the benefits of using the LUKSO Standard Proposals (LSPs) and outlines the differences between building on LUKSO compared to other EVM chains.

## Key Benefits

The table below highlights the features of the LSPs and their benefits:

| Feature                                        | Benefits                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **🗄️ Metadata in one place**                   | When using traditional web3 wallets, a user has to fill in its same infos again every time it creates a new account on a new dApp (_e.g: username, biography, social media accounts_) <br/> <br/>Universal Profile stores user data in one single place (the 🆙 contract storage). This allows any dApp to retrieve the same information, and makes dApp onboarding easier and faster.  |
| **⛽️ Gas-Less transactions**                  | Universal Profiles enable gas-less transactions. The relayer pay the gas fees and does not require the user to hold native tokens to pay for the transaction fee. <br/> <br/>Without a [Transaction Relay Service](../standards/accounts/lsp15-transaction-relayer-api.md), the [controller](./concepts.md#controller) of the Universal Profile must be funded to execute transactions. |
| **🔑 Multi-Control through permissions**       | Universal Profiles can be controlled by multiple EOAs with various permission levels. Controllers can be on different devices or represent dApps, each with specific access rights, such as token transfers, playlist management, or account recovery.                                                                                                                                  |
| **📢 Notification and Reactivity**             | The 🆙 can be customized to react differently based on different events it receives. For instance, the default implementation automatically register new received assets.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **⚙️ Extendability with pluggable Extensions** | New features (like new function selectors not present by default in the smart contract code) can be added to a Universal Profile, using a system of extensions. <br/><br/>See our guide [**Extending Universal Profile functionalities**](./universal-profile/advanced-guides/extend-profile-functionalities.md) for more details.                                                      |

Universal Profiles can be controlled through multiple EOAs (and their associated private keys), where each private key can be allowed or restricted to specific actions via permissions.

These [**controllers**](./universal-profile/key-manager/get-controller-permissions.md) can be on multiple devices (laptop, desktop, mobile, hardware wallet like ledger) and represent:

- EOAs or other 🆙
- dapps protocols (defi trading app, gaming app), granted specific access to the Universal Profile.

Some real-life examples for a user's Universal Profile could be:

- A defi app can transfer only a specific token to a particular pool for trading.
- A music dApp can only update a list of music playlists in the Universal Profile's storage.
- A family member can be granted recovery access for trusted third-party recovery.

| **🗄️ Dynamic Metadata**                        | Like Universal Profile, digital assets based on the LSP7 and LSP8 standards can hold an **unlimited quantity of metadata** for any various type of information considered relevant to the token or NFT collection. This can include: <br/><br/><ul><li>Icons and image.</li><li>The creators of the tokens / NFT collection.</li><li>The list of exchanges where this token can be found.</li></ul>For LSP8 collections, it is also possible to **set metadata specific to each NFT token IDs** thanks to the functions [`setDataForTokenId(...)` and `setDataBatchForTokenIds(...)`](../contracts/overview/NFT/set-nft-metadata.md).<br/>This enables to create systems such as dynamic NFTs, where the traits and attributes of a NFT can programmed to change or evolve overtime according to certain conditions, logics or triggers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **📢 Notify on Transfer**                      | Sender & Receiver are notified on each token transfer. This allows to program the sender and recipient contracts (a Universal Profile 🆙, a Vault, a Marketplace, a Liquidity pool) custom logic to react based on the type of notifications (_e.g: "I have sent / received some tokens / NFTs"_). This could include: <br/><br/><ul><li>Registering / Removing tokens from your list of received assets.</li><li>Block receiving spam tokens that can contain malicious logic to steal user's funds if interacting with such token contracts, by filtering them against a spam or blacklist registry.</li><li>Forward automatically a certain percentage of the tokens received to a specific address (_e.g: a Vault to implement "save the change" schemes, a wallet for savings, a family member)_</li><li>Implement automated mechanisms to re-distribute equally and proportionally the tokens received in a trustless manner (_e.g: distribute dividends to shareholders, or bonuses to employees._)</li></ul>The [LSP1 Universal Receiver standard](../standards/accounts/lsp1-universal-receiver-delegate.md#how-delegation-works) offers many ways to build innovative automation systems, so that users can enjoy a better and safer experience interacting with digital assets on the blockchain. |
| **⚙️ Extendability with pluggable Extensions** | New features (like new function selectors not present by default in the smart contract code) can be added to a Digital Asset, using a system of extensions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **✋🏻 Safety to prevent accidental transfers**  | The `transfer(...)` function of [LSP7](../standards/tokens/LSP7-Digital-Asset.md) and [LSP8](../standards/tokens/LSP8-Identifiable-Digital-Asset.md) contains a [`bool force`](../standards/tokens/LSP7-Digital-Asset#force-mint-and-transfer) parameter that can prevent accidental transfers. Such scenarios can occur for instance when: <br/><br/><ul><li>An incorrect address was pasted in an input field on a dApp or blockchain explorer.</li><li>An incorrect `address` parameter was passed within an internal transaction of a complex interaction flow, like a swap for instance or a token forwarding.</li><li>A smart contract that can hold tokens / NFTs but does not have any ways to transfer them back, leading the tokens to be stuck forever under this address.</li><li>Sending tokens to an EOA address, which might not be able to register the funds in its list of received assets automatically.</li></ul>The `bool force` parameter ensures that users and smart contracts are not transferring tokens to addresses that could potentially not hold or re-transfer the token.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
